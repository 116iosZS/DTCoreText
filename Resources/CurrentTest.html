What's happened to the Sun?  

Sometimes it looks like the Sun is being viewed through a large 
<a href="http://www.opticalres.com/optics_for_kids/kidoptx_p2.html"
>lens</a>.  

In the above case, however, there are actually millions of lenses: 
<a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/snowcrystals/halos/halos.htm"
>ice crystals</a>. 

As water freezes in the upper 
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/earth/atmosphere.html"
>atmosphere</a>, small, flat, six-sided, ice crystals might be formed. 

As these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_crystal"
>crystals</a> flutter to the ground, much time is spent
with their faces flat, parallel to the ground. 

An <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLYg5jptvCc">observe</a>r may pass through the same plane as 
many of the falling ice crystals near sunrise or sunset. 

During this alignment, each crystal can act like a miniature lens, 
refracting sunlight into our 
<a href="ap100208.html">view</a> and creating 
<a href="http://www.atoptics.co.uk/halo/parhelia.htm"
>phenomena like parhelia</a>, the technical term for 
<a href="ap990823.html">sundogs</a>.  

The above image was taken

Visible in the image center is the Sun, while two bright
