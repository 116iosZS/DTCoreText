<h1>Image Handling</h1>
<p>Some basic <b>image</b> handling has been implemented</p>
<h2>Inline</h2>
<p>So far <image width="20" height="20" src="Oliver.jpg"> images work inline, sitting on the line's baseline.</p>
<h2>Block</h2>
<p>There is a known issue with images as blocks, outside of p tags.<p>
<image width="50" height="50" src="Oliver.jpg">
<p>An Image outside of P is treated as a paragraph</p>
<h2>Supported Attributes</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>width</b>, <b>height</b> in pixels
<li><b>src</b> with a local file path relative to the app bundle</l>
