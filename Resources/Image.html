<h1>Image Handling</h1>
<p>Some basic <b>image</b> <del>handling has been implemented</del></p>
<h2>Inline</h2>
<p>So far <image width="20" height="20" src="Oliver.jpg"> images work inline, sitting on the line's baseline.</p>
<h2>Block</h2>
<p>There is a known issue with images as blocks, outside of p tags.
<image width="50" height="50" src="Oliver.jpg">
<p>This should be on a new line, but it's not.</p>
<p>There is also an issue if there is no more text following an inline image.</p>
