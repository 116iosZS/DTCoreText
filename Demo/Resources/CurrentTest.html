<h3>UITextView (iOS 6)</h3>
<p>You can generate attributed strings that work in UIKit, primarily UITextView and UILabel. You have to pass the <span style="font-family:Courier;">DTUseiOS6Attributes</span> option to the initWithHTMLData: method to enable iOS 6 compatible attributes. Note that these will only be used if actually running on a device with iOS 6 or higher.</p>
<p>In the demo app the first tap displays the attributed string with the traditional CoreText and custom attributes in a DTCoreTextAttributedTextView. The new "iOS 6" tab on the right (only visible on iOS 6 or higher) displays the attributed string with iOS 6 compatible attributes in a UITextView."

<h3>Working Features<h3>
<p>Normal Text, <del>Strike Out</del>, <u>Underlined</u>, <b>Bold</b>, <em>Italic</em>, <span style="font-variant:small-caps">SmallCapps</span></p>
<p>Setting a <span style="background-color:yellow;">background color</span> or changing the <span style="color:red">text color</span>.</p>
	
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<p>Support for changing the line height is broken in iOS 6. As soon as you have more than one font in the attributed string the minimum and maximum line height attributes of the paragraph style are being ignored.</p>

<h3>Not Supported</h3>
<p>Since there is no way to reserve extra space on a glyph there is no way to display custom views or inline images</p>
<p>Horizontal Rule (hr) is not supported.</p>
<p>Native lists and text boxes are private to NSParagraphStyle</p>
